# React + Vite Todo List Application

Hi! This is the repo for my todo list application created with react + vite!

In this app, you can create tasks that you'd like Todo, mark those tasks as complete when they're done, and delete tasks you no longer want to display.

The Todo list data persists on page reload because it is leveraging your browser's local storage!
